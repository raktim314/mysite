Hi, this is Raktim! A passionate programmer, aspiring data scientist. I studied MSc Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Leeds, United Kingdom. Before that, I graduated from Chittagong College under National University, Bangladesh with a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics.

I got introduced with programming during the 2nd-year of my bachelor which was with Fortran77 language. But it was a very limited implementation and did not find much interest. After a few years, during my MSc at Leeds, I learned Matlab for my coursework which was an implementation in a regression problem. Later on, I worked on developing exploratory software to find a numerical solution of the famous Navier-Stokes equations by using MAC algorithm.

I started my career as a Mathematics lecturer in Bangladesh, then I switched to IT industry and worked as a Python programmer for a few months. Please visit my Linkedin profile for more details.

## Why this blog
In this blog, I will try to summarise my learning process. It also serves the purpose of helping people with similar issues as I had and helps many others to grow and make progress with me.
