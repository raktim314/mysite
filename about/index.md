Hi, this is Raktim! A passionate programmer, aspiring data scientist. I studied MSc in Mathematics and Computer Science from University of Leeds, United Kingdom. Before that I graduated from Chittagong College under National University, Bangladesh with a BSc (hons) in Mathematics.

I got introduced with programming during my 2nd year bachelor which was with Fortran77 language. But it was a very limited implementation and did not find much interest. After a few years, during my MSc at Leeds, I learned Matlab for my coursework which was an implementation in a regression problem. Later on, I worked on developing an exploratory software to solve famous Naveir-Stokes equations.

I started my career as a Mathematics lecturer in Bangladesh, then I switched to IT industry and worked as an Python programmer for few years. Please visit my Linkedin profile for more details.

## Why this blog
In this blog I will try to summarise my learning process. It also serves the purpose of helping people with similar issues as I had and help many others to grow and make progress with me.
