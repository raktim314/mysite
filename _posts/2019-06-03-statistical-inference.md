### Statistical Inference

The world we live in is complex, random, and uncertain. At the same
time, it’s one big data-generating machine.
As we commute to work on subways and in cars, as our blood moves
through our bodies, as we’re shopping, emailing, procrastinating at
work by browsing the Internet and watching the stock market, as we’re
building things, eating things, talking to our friends and family about
things, while factories are producing products, this all at least poten‐
tially produces data.
Imagine spending 24 hours looking out the window, and for every
minute, counting and recording the number of people who pass by.
Or gathering up everyone who lives within a mile of your house and
making them tell you how many email messages they receive every
day for the next year. Imagine heading over to your local hospital and
rummaging around in the blood samples looking for patterns in the

Chapter 2: Statistical Inference, Exploratory Data Analysis, and the Data Science ProcessDNA. That all sounded creepy, but it wasn’t supposed to. The point
here is that the processes in our lives are actually data-generating
processes.
We’d like ways to describe, understand, and make sense of these pro‐
cesses, in part because as scientists we just want to understand the
world better, but many times, understanding these processes is part of
the solution to problems we’re trying to solve.
Data represents the traces of the real-world processes, and exactly
which traces we gather are decided by our data collection or sampling
method. You, the data scientist, the observer, are turning the world
into data, and this is an utterly subjective, not objective, process.
After separating the process from the data collection, we can see clearly
that there are two sources of randomness and uncertainty. Namely, the
randomness and uncertainty underlying the process itself, and the
uncertainty associated with your underlying data collection methods.
Once you have all this data, you have somehow captured the world,
